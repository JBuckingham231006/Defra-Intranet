WARNING: 
You are running the legacy version of PnP PowerShell.

This version will be archived soon which means that while staying available, no updates or fixes will be released.
Consider installing the newer prereleased cross-platform version of PnP PowerShell.
This version has numerous improvements and many more cmdlets available.
To install the new version:

Uninstall-Module -Name SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline -AllVersions -Force
Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell

Read more about the new cross-platform version of PnP PowerShell at

https://pnp.github.io/powershell

To hide this message set the environment variable PNPLEGACYMESSAGE to "false"
In PowerShell add $env:PNPLEGACYMESSAGE='false' to your profile. Alternatively use 'Connect-PnPOnline -Url [yoururl] -WarningAction Ignore'
